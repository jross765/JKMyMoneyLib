# Notes on the Module "Tools"

This module is a collection of various ready-to-use tools reading and manipulating KMyMoney XML files. They are, of course, based on the module "Base", "API" and "Extensions", but *not* (technically) on "Examples".

You will notice that the tools partially pull on the examples in the "Examples" module, and thus we have a *logical* dependency here. Currently, there are many similarties between the two modules, but expect those two modules to deviate from one another in the course of the future releases to come.
